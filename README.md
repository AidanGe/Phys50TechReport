# Phys50TechReport
All the necessary files for the code I used for the tech report.

"transmissionCalculator.py" is the file I used for calculating the weighted average of transmission for the data, based on the spectrometry data and the ND filter supplier's transmission data.
Fitter > "doublexponentialfitter.py" is where I fit the data according to my own needs, following Prof. Saeta's Jupyter notebook on editing the phys50 fitter functions myself. It uses the "fitter.py" file.
